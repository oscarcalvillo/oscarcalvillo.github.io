				<p id="part1">Hello. Welcome to my website! My name is Oscar Calvillo and I go to San Lorenzo Highschool in San Lorenzo. My favourite colour is blue.</p>

				<p id="part2">Things that you should know about me are that for one I love cats! Especially as pets. If you haven't gotten to know this about me yet then you must have been living under a rock. Another thing that you should get to know about me is that I love to spend time with my friends and family. I really enjoy earing a well made meal. And most of all I really like to play video games such as FortNite, Fortnite, fortNite, FORTnite, fortNITE, fortnite,FORTNITE, Clash of Clans, and Clash Royale.</p>

				<p id="part3">Some other things that I like to do on my spare etime is watch Youtube videos and Twitch Streamers. My favourite Youtubers and Streamers are compiled of the following poeple; Ninja, Vikkstar123, Miniminter, Dude Perfect, I Am Wildcat, Fitz, Suda, KSI, The Sidemen, NigaHiga, VanossGaming, DramaAlert, and more! </p>

				<p>Now some wierd/interesting facts about me are that I do not like to swin in the ocean. However I do like to stay up at night and look up at the stars. Wierdly enough, I think that my favourite spot to do that in would be at the beach. I also do not spell the word 'color' the 'right' way, as I like to spell it with a 'u' as 'colour'. The same thing applies with the word 'favourite'.</p>

				<p>I also have 2 brothers and a sister. Their Names are Julio, Esmeralda, and Edwin. I hope this helped you learn a little more about me, and I hope you enjoyed your visit!</p>
